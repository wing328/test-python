## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] defaults to nulltype.Null
**account_moid** | **str** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**create_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**domain_group_moid** | **str** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**mod_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**moid** | **str** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**owners** | **[str]** |  | [optional] 
**shared_scope** | **str** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**permission_resources** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**display_names** | [**DisplayNames**](DisplayNames.md) |  | [optional] 
**api_version** | **int** | The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector&#39;s framework. If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded. | [optional] [readonly] 
**app_partition_number** | **int** | The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector. | [optional] [readonly] 
**connection_id** | **str** | The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter. | [optional] [readonly] 
**connection_reason** | **str** | If &#39;connectionStatus&#39; is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight. | [optional] [readonly] 
**connection_status** | **str** | The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight. | [optional] [readonly]  if omitted the server will use the default value of ""
**connection_status_last_change_time** | **datetime** | The last time at which the &#39;connectionStatus&#39; property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight. | [optional] [readonly] 
**connector_version** | **str** | The version of the device connector running on the managed device. | [optional] [readonly] 
**device_external_ip_address** | **str** | The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration. This could be the IP address of the managed device&#39;s interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP addresss when the managed device is deployed in a private network. | [optional] [readonly] 
**proxy_app** | **str** | The name of the app which will proxy the messages to the device connector. | [optional] [readonly] 
**selector** | **str** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**link** | **str** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
