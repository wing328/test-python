# OsTemplateFile

A TemplateFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended installation. The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers. Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/. The values for these placeholders shall be given during OS installation in the form of 'additionalProperties' in os.OsInstall object.
