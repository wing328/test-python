## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**datastore_count** | **int** | Count of all datastores associated with this cluster. | [optional] 
**datacenter** | [**VirtualizationVmwareDatacenterRelationship**](VirtualizationVmwareDatacenterRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**account_moid** | **str** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**create_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**domain_group_moid** | **str** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**mod_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**moid** | **str** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**owners** | **[str]** |  | [optional] 
**shared_scope** | **str** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**permission_resources** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**display_names** | [**DisplayNames**](DisplayNames.md) |  | [optional] 
**hypervisor_type** | **str** | Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "Unknown"
**identity** | **str** | The internally generated identity of this cluster. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the cluster object. In case of VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference). | [optional] [readonly] 
**memory_capacity** | [**VirtualizationMemoryCapacity**](VirtualizationMemoryCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The user-provided name for this cluster to facilitate identification. | [optional] [readonly] 
**processor_capacity** | [**VirtualizationComputeCapacity**](VirtualizationComputeCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**status** | **str** | Cluster health status as reported by the hypervisor platform. | [optional] [readonly]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "Unknown"
**total_cores** | **int** | Total number of CPU cores in this cluster. It is a cumulative number across all hosts in the cluster. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
