# AssetHttpConnection

HttpConnection provides the necessary details for Intersight to connect to and authenticate with a managed target over an HTTP connection.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**credential** | [**AssetCredential**](AssetCredential.md) |  | [optional] 
**is_secure** | **bool** | Indicates whether a connection to the target should be established using HTTPS. | [optional] 
**management_address** | **str** | The DNS hostname or IP Address, either IPv4 or IPv6, to be used to connect to the managed target. | [optional] 
**port** | **int** | The port number to be used to to connect to the managed target. Values 1-65535 indicate a port number to be used. A value of 0 is not a valid port number and instead indicates that the default management port, as defined by the documentation of the managed target, should be used to establish a connection. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
