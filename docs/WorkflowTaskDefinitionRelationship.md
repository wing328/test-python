**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional]

**version** | **int** | The version of the task definition so we can support multiple versions of a task definition. | [optional] 
**catalog** | [**WorkflowCatalogRelationship**](WorkflowCatalogRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**implemented_tasks** | [**[WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship], none_type**](WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to workflowTaskDefinition resources. | [optional] 
**interface_task** | [**WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship**](WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**selector** | **str** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly]
