# TechsupportmanagementTechSupportBundle

A request to collect techsupport and upload it to Intersight Storage Service. The serial number, PID and/or relationship to the target resource provided by the user is used to determine the device type for techsupport collection. If the serial number, PID and target resource are specified in the request, the values must match. Valid values of device types are network.Element for fabric interconnect, compute.Blade for blade server, compute.RackUnit for rack server, equipment.Chassis for chassis, equipment.IoCard for IO Module, equipment.FEX for fabric extender and adapter.Unit for network adapter. UCSM techsupport is collected for device type network.Element. Chassis techsupport is collected for compute.Blade, equipment.Chassis, equipment.IoCard, and blade adapter.Unit. Server techsupport is collected for compute.RackUnit and rack adapter.Unit. Fabric extender techsupport is collected for device type equipment.FEX. Hyper Flex node level techsupport is collected when the request specifies the platform type (HX) and the device type is Hyperflex.Node.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**device_identifier** | **str** | The device identifier used to uniquely identify an individual device. | [optional] [readonly] 
**device_type** | **str** | The device type obtained from the inventory. | [optional] [readonly] 
**pid** | **str** | Product identification of the device. | [optional] 
**platform_param** | [**ConnectorPlatformParamBase**](ConnectorPlatformParamBase.md) |  | [optional] 
**platform_type** | **str** | The platform type of the device. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of ""
**serial** | **str** | Serial number of the device. | [optional] 
**device_registration** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**target_resource** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**tech_support_status** | [**TechsupportmanagementTechSupportStatusRelationship**](TechsupportmanagementTechSupportStatusRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**account_moid** | **str** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**create_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**domain_group_moid** | **str** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**mod_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**moid** | **str** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**owners** | **[str]** |  | [optional] 
**shared_scope** | **str** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**permission_resources** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**display_names** | [**DisplayNames**](DisplayNames.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
