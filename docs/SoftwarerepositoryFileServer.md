# SoftwarerepositoryFileServer

An external software repository which serves as the source of the file to be imported into the image catalog. If the source is available in the user's local machine, then the file is copied or imported into Intersight's local repository. If not, only a pointer to the file in the external repository is created in the image catalog. For more information, please refer to the softwarerepositoryUploader and softwarerepositoryFile object descriptions where this type is used.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
