# IamApiKey

API keys are used to programatically perform API calls. API keys can be created by passing purpose field, which is a description for the application using API keys. Maximum of 3 API keys per user is allowed. API key will have RSA key pair generated and as part of create request key MOID, private and public key in PEM format are returned. In Intersight only the public key is stored. Client side private key is stored and is used for signature calculation. API key requests are authenticated using RSA SHA 256 signature validations. If the incoming request for authorization has X-Starship-Token, then session based authorization is done, else API key based authorization is performed. Once User, API key and Account are found and signature verification succeeds, then the privilege validations are performed.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**hash_algorithm** | **str** | The cryptographic hash algorithm to calculate the message digest. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "SHA256"
**key_spec** | [**PkixKeyGenerationSpec**](PkixKeyGenerationSpec.md) |  | [optional] 
**private_key** | **str** | Holds the private key for the API key. | [optional] 
**purpose** | **str** | The purpose of the API Key. | [optional] 
**signing_algorithm** | **str** | The signing algorithm used by the client to authenticate API requests to Intersight. The signing algorithm must be compatible with the key generation specification. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5"
**permission** | [**IamPermissionRelationship**](IamPermissionRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**user** | [**IamUserRelationship**](IamUserRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**account_moid** | **str** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**create_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**domain_group_moid** | **str** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**mod_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**moid** | **str** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**owners** | **[str]** |  | [optional] 
**shared_scope** | **str** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**permission_resources** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**display_names** | [**DisplayNames**](DisplayNames.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
