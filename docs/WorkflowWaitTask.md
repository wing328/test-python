# WorkflowWaitTask

A WaitTask will remain in progress until marked success or failed by an external trigger. The timeout for wait task is 180 days, so a workflow can wait for task status update for upto 180 days. Currently the only supported means to update the task status is through an API that provides the status of the task runtime instance. Once the wait task status has been set the workflow will continue with the execution based on the task status.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**prompts** | [**[WorkflowWaitTaskPrompt]**](WorkflowWaitTaskPrompt.md) |  | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | The description of this task instance in the workflow. | [optional] 
**label** | **str** | A user defined label identifier of the workflow task used for UI display. | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | The name of the task within the workflow and it must be unique among all WorkflowTasks within a workflow definition. This name serves as the internal unique identifier for the task and is used to pick input and output parameters to feed into other tasks. | [optional] 
**input_parameters** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | JSON formatted map that defines the input given to the task. JSONPath is used for chaining output from previous tasks as inputs into the current task. The format to specify the mapping is &#39;${Source.input/output.JsonPath}&#39;. &#39;Source&#39; can be either workflow or the name of the task within the workflow. You can map the task input to either a workflow input or a task output. Following this is JSON path expression to extract JSON fragment from source&#39;s input/output. | [optional] 
**on_failure** | **str** | This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task fails.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. | [optional] 
**on_success** | **str** | This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task succeeds.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
