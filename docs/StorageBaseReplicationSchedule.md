**frequency** | **str** | Replication frequency. It is an interval at which replication is set to trigger. Examples:     PT2H, Snapshot is generated every 2 hours.     P30D, Snapshot is scheduled for every 30 days.     PT2H34M56.123S is 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 123 milliseconds. | [optional] [readonly] 
**name** | **str** | Replication schedule name. | [optional] [readonly] 
**replication_time** | **str** | Preferred time of day at which to replicate the snapshots on target array. It is applicable only if the replication frequency is set for a day or more. Format: hh:mm:ss Example: 15:00:00, Replication is set for 3:00 PM. | [optional] [readonly]

**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional]
