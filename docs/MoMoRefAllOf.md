# MoMoRefAllOf

Definition of the list of properties defined in 'mo.MoRef', excluding properties defined in parent classes.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**moid** | **str** | The Moid of the referenced REST resource. | [optional] [readonly] 
**selector** | **str** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**link** | **str** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional]
