## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous.

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**fip_enabled** | **bool** | Status of FIP protocol on the adapter interfaces. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
