# IamSsoSessionAttributes

Session attributes required to maintain states of SP and IdP.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**idp_session_expiration** | **str** | SAML SessionNotOnOrAfter attribute sent by IdP in the assertion. IdP uses this to control for how long SP session maybe. SP does not issue SLO if the session is not valid. | [optional] [readonly] 
**idp_session_index** | **str** | SAML SessionIndex attribute sent by IdP in the assertion. This has to be sent back to IdP in LogoutRequest. | [optional] [readonly] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
