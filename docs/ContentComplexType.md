# ContentComplexType

If the given API/device response is a collection of items, each item and its properties can be modeled as a complex type. The types are uniquely named within the grammar and provides the list of parameters to be extracted from each item. Name of the complex type can be used as the type of parameter that represents the complex value.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**name** | **str** | The unique name of this complex type within the grammar specification. | [optional] 
**parameters** | [**[ContentBaseParameter]**](ContentBaseParameter.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
