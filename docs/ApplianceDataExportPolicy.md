# ApplianceDataExportPolicy

Data Export Policy is a category-based data collection policy that enables or disables data export (data collection) from the Intersight Appliance to the Intersight. The Data Export Policy configuration is organized hierarchically as follows.   Global:      Inventory:         Network         Storage      TechSupport When the DataExportPolicy for a category is enabled/disabled, all the sub-category configurations are enabled/disabled as well. For example, if you enable/disable Inventory, all its sub-category configurations (ie. Network and Storage) are also enabled/disabled.
