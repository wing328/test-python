# AssetSudiInfo

The SUDI is an X.509v3 certificate, which maintains the product identifier and serial number. The identity is implemented at manufacturing and chained to a publicly identifiable root certificate authority. It can be used as an unchangeable identity for configuration, security, auditing, and management. This strucure contains the SUDI information read from the device's Trust Anchor Module (TAM).
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**pid** | **str** | The device model (PID) extracted from the X.509 SUDI Leaf Certificate. | [optional] 
**serial_number** | **str** | The device SerialNumber extracted from the X.509 SUDI Leaf Certiicate. | [optional] 
**signature** | **str** | The signature is obtained by taking the base64 encoding of the Serial Number + PID + Status, taking the SHA256 hash and then signing with the SUDI X.509 Leaf Certifiate. | [optional] 
**status** | **str** | The validation status of the device. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "DeviceStatusUnknown"
**sudi_certificate** | [**X509Certificate**](X509Certificate.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
