# OsConfigurationFile

A ConfigurationFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended installation. The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers. Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/. The template supports placeholders for all the properties of os.Answers MO type as well as any additional user-defined properties. The values for these placeholders shall be given during OS installation in the form of os.Answers type and 'additionalProperties' in os.OsInstall object.

**file_content** | **str** | The content of the entire configuration file is stored as value. The content can either be a static file content or a template content. The template is expected to conform to the golang template syntax. The values from os.Answers properties will be used to populate this template. | [optional]
