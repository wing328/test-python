# HyperflexCapabilityInfo

A capabilityInfo is like a feature set and/or feature limit for different components of a HyperFlex Cluster. A set of constraints defines the rules, and the corresponding value either determines if the feature would work on a HyperFlex cluster with specific component set, or corresponds to a limit for a set of HyperFlex components. For example, \"minUcsVersion\" for HyperFlex version \"4.0.1a\" corresponds to \"3.2.3\" or \"minHxdpVersion\" for HyperFlex Upgrade operation is \"4.0.1a\" etc. This data can be captured as a capability and at run-time, decision can be made to proceed with the intended operation or not, or proceed with the intended operation with a value catered to specific feature sets.

------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**capability_constraints** | [**[HclConstraint]**](HclConstraint.md) |  | [optional] 
**name** | **str** | Name of the capability or feature set consisting of a collection of constraint rules and value. | [optional] 
**value** | **str** | Capability Value which is valid only iff all specified constraints match. | [optional] [readonly] 
**app_catalog** | [**HyperflexAppCatalogRelationship**](HyperflexAppCatalogRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**account_moid** | **str** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**create_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**domain_group_moid** | **str** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**mod_time** | **datetime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly]

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**permission_resources** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**display_names** | [**DisplayNames**](DisplayNames.md) |  | [optional]
