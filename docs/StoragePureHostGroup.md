# StoragePureHostGroup

A host group represents a collection of hosts with common connectivity to volumes. Once a connection has been established between a host group and a volume, all of the hosts within the host group are able to access the volume through the connection. These connections are called shared connections because the connection is shared between all of the hosts within the host group.
