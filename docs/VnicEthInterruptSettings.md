# VnicEthInterruptSettings

Interrupt settings for the virtual ethernet interface.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**coalescing_time** | **int** | The time to wait between interrupts or the idle period that must be encountered before an interrupt is sent. To turn off interrupt coalescing, enter 0 (zero) in this field. | [optional] 
**coalescing_type** | **str** | Interrupt Coalescing Type. This can be one of the following:- MIN  — The system waits for the time specified in the Coalescing Time field before sending another interrupt event IDLE — The system does not send an interrupt until there is a period of no activity lasting as least as long as the time specified in the Coalescing Time field. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "MIN"
**count** | **int** | The number of interrupt resources to allocate. Typical value is be equal to the number of completion queue resources. | [optional] 
**mode** | **str** | Preferred driver interrupt mode. This can be one of the following:- MSIx — Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) with the optional extension. MSI   — MSI only. INTx  — PCI INTx interrupts. MSIx is the recommended option. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "MSIx"
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
