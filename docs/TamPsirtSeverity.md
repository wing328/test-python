# TamPsirtSeverity

< Severity level of a security advisory. Each advisory type (psirt/field notice etc.) may have a different method of calculating the severity. For e.g. a PSIRT severity may depend upon the corresponding CVSS score where as field notices are always critical in nature.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**object_type** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**level** | **str** | Severity level associated with the security advisory. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "critical"
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
