# StorageStoragePolicy

The storage policy models the reusable storage related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows creation of RAID groups using existing disk group policies and virtual drives on the drive groups. The user has options to move all unused disks to JBOD or Unconfigured good state. The encryption of drives can be enabled through this policy using remote keys from a KMIP server.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**class_id** | **str** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly]

**retain_policy_virtual_drives** | **bool** | Retains the virtual drives defined in policy if they exist already. If this flag is false, the existing virtual drives are removed and created again based on virtual drives in the policy. | [optional] 
**unused_disks_state** | **str** | Unused Disks State is used to specify the state, unconfigured good or jbod, in which the disks that are not used in this policy should be moved. | [optional]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "UnconfiguredGood"
**virtual_drives** | [**[StorageVirtualDriveConfig]**](StorageVirtualDriveConfig.md) |  | [optional] 
**disk_group_policies** | [**[StorageDiskGroupPolicyRelationship], none_type**](StorageDiskGroupPolicyRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to storageDiskGroupPolicy resources. | [optional] 
**organization** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**profiles** | [**[PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship], none_type**](PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. | [optional]

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**tags** | [**[MoTag]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**version_context** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestors** | [**[MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly]
