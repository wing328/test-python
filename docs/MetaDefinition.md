**object_type** | **str** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**access_privileges** | [**[MetaAccessPrivilege]**](MetaAccessPrivilege.md) |  | [optional] 
**ancestor_classes** | **[str]** |  | [optional] 
**is_concrete** | **bool** | Boolean flag to specify whether the meta class is a concrete class or not. | [optional] [readonly] 
**meta_type** | **str** | Indicates whether the meta class is a complex type or managed object. | [optional] [readonly]  if omitted the server will use the default value of "ManagedObject"
**name** | **str** | The fully-qualified class name of the Managed Object or complex type. For example, \&quot;compute:Blade\&quot; where the Managed Object is \&quot;Blade\&quot; and the package is &#39;compute&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**namespace** | **str** | The namespace of the meta. | [optional] [readonly] 
**parent_class** | **str** | The fully-qualified name of the parent metaclass in the class inheritance hierarchy. | [optional] [readonly] 
**permission_supported** | **bool** | Boolean flag to specify whether instances of this class type can be specified in permissions for instance based access control.

**properties** | [**[MetaPropDefinition]**](MetaPropDefinition.md) |  | [optional] 
**rbac_resource** | **bool** | Boolean flag to specify whether instances of this class type can be assigned to resource groups that are part of an organization for access control. Inventoried physical/logical objects which needs access control should have rbacResource&#x3D;yes. These objects are not part of any organization by default like device registrations and should be assigned to organizations for access control. Profiles, policies, workflow definitions which are created by specifying organization need not have this flag set. | [optional] [readonly] 
**relationships** | [**[MetaRelationshipDefinition]**](MetaRelationshipDefinition.md) |  | [optional]

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly]
