    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document. This document was created on 2020-06-30T07:31:54Z.  # noqa: E501

        Args:
            class_id (str): The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value.
            object_type (str): The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            data_reduction (float): Ratio of mapped sectors within a volume versus the amount of physical space the data occupies after data compression and deduplication. The data reduction ratio does not include thin provisioning savings. For example, a data reduction ratio of 5.0 means that for every 5 MB the host writes to the array, 1 MB is stored on the array&#39;s flash modules.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            snapshot (int): Physical space occupied by the snapshots, represented in bytes.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            thin_provisioned (float): Percentage of volume sectors that do not contain host-written data because the hosts have not written data to them or the sectors have been explicitly trimmed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            total_reduction (float): Ratio of provisioned sectors within a volume versus the amount of physical space the data occupies after reduction via data compression and deduplication and with thin provisioning savings. Total reduction is data reduction with thin provisioning savings. For example, a total reduction ratio of 10.0 means that for every 10 MB of provisioned space, 1 MB is stored on the array&#39;s flash modules.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            volume (int): Physical space occupied by volume data, excluding shared, array metadata and snapshots. Size id represented in bytes.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            available (int): Total consumable storage capacity represented in bytes. System may reserve some space for internal purposes which is excluded from total capacity.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            free (int): Unused space available for applications to consume, represented in bytes.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
